# Cricket-Game-Predictor
# ABSTRACT
Cricket is one of the popular sports played in the world. It is ranked as the second most watched game in the world. The Cricket game has produced multi million revenue for countries. There is a lot of interest in predicting the outcome of a cricket match in their corresponding formats like one-day-International, T20 and Test Match. Predicting the game of cricket has not been easy. Apart from the skills of players there are many other factors which play vital role in winning a cricket match including Natural factors like weather conditions.   
Prediction systems for different sports have already been developed been but itâ€™s yet to be done for the game of cricket. We will develop a Cricket predictor which will predict the game before itâ€™s been played based on teams records. 

# Implementation
 NaÃ¯ve Bayes, 
 Logistic regression, 
 Random Forests, 
 Decision Trees,
 SVM,
 Neural Networks 
 Nearest Neighbor
 
 
 
 # Conclusion
 This analysis produced some of the energetic features that will rise to remarkable results. The previous work has targeted on perspective for predicating the match outcome on current statistics of match being played but this system uses historical data of teams to predict the result
